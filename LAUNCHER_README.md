# Universal Launcher - Fixed Version

## Problem Solved
The timeout issue was caused by:
1. **pyenv Python hanging** - The pyenv-managed Python was causing timeouts
2. **mdfind command slowness** - macOS Spotlight searches were taking too long

## Solutions Provided

### 1. Shell Script Launcher (Recommended)
**File**: `launch.sh`
- âœ… No Python dependencies
- âœ… Instant execution
- âœ… Direct macOS `open` command usage

```bash
# Usage examples
./launch.sh website github.com chrome
./launch.sh website google.com brave
./launch.sh app Calculator
./launch.sh app Windsurf
./launch.sh list-apps
./launch.sh list-browsers
```

### 2. Fixed Python Launcher
**File**: `fast_launcher.py`
- âœ… Uses system Python (`/usr/bin/python3`)
- âœ… No slow mdfind searches
- âœ… Simple ls-based app listing

```bash
# Usage examples
/usr/bin/python3 fast_launcher.py list-browsers
/usr/bin/python3 fast_launcher.py website github.com chrome
```
